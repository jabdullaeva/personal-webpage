       I am passionate about technology and innovation. As an aspiring programmer, 
       I thribe on tackling complex problems and creating bright solutions.
       I first discovered my love for programming during my involvement in competitive robotics.
       As one of the leaders of an award-winning FIRST Tech Challenge team #14212, 
       I honed my skills in Java, Python, C++, HTML and CSS by designing and coding robots to
       autonomously navigate obstacle courses. This experience sparkled in me a relentless curiosity 
       to push boundaries and expand my caoabilities.
